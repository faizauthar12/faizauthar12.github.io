# Who am i?
Hi, my name is Muhammad Alfaiz Khisma Authar, and I'm a student.
I live in East Jakarta.
I'm a tech enthusiast, my father was introduced me about computer when he bring his PC from office. I'm so excited with what my father did with this PC.
He is doing his job in front of me and I'm amazed with his works on Autocad.
It made me want to learn about technology.

## Who is faizauthar12?
On the web and my close friend, I'm also known as "faizauthar12", I have been using this identity since long time ago.
I was creating an account for playing a games, the website needs to include numeral stuff on my username, so that i decided to use "faizauthar12" as my username, since then I'm using it for all of my account.

I have a few of social media such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/faizauthar12), [Telegram](http://t.me/faizauthar12),  and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/faizauthar12/).
I'm also known as Recognized Developer / Contribur on [XDA-Developers](https://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=5689422).
I have been contributed well since 2015.

## When I start doing this?
back then in 2013, i got my first handheld device it is [Samsung Galaxy Fame](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_fame_s6810-5279.php). It has 3,5" display, 512MB RAM, 1300mAh.
It runs android Jeally Beans with TouchWhiz skin on top of it.
Samsung load lots of bloatware, I can't do a multitasking stuff with it.
I'm trying to open as much as apps it can run, unfortunately the last apps will be killed shortly after i open a new app.
I find out there is way to fix this problem by custom, tweaking, and also mod the system.
